Recording a macro
	Each register is identified by a letter a to z.

	To enter a macro, type:

	q<letter><commands>q
	To execute the macro <number> times (once by default), type:

	<number>@<letter>
	So, the complete process looks like:

	qd	start recording to register d
	...	your complex series of commands
	q	stop recording
	@d	execute your macro
	@@	execute your macro again
